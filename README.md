## Features

_Enabled by default_

- Always use the Latest Tweets (chronological) timeline - automatically switches you back when Twitter decides they'd rather you were on the "Home" (algorithmic) timeline because "engagement"
- Move retweets to a separate Retweets timeline, or hide them entirely
- Hide "Who to follow" / "Follow some Topics" etc. sections in the timeline
- Hide "More Tweets" when viewing a tweet from an external link
- Fast blocking - skips the confirmation dialog when you try to block someone
- Remove sidebar content (Trends, Who to follow, sidefooter)
- Hide the Messages drawer
- Hide analytics buttons
- Remove some less-used links from the primary nav (Explore, Bookmarks, Links)
- Hide the account switcher in the primary nav footer
- Use the site's base font size and normal font weight in the primary nav to make it less distracting (using your selected font size from the Display / Customize your view dialog)

## Optional features

_Disabled by default_

- Hide tweets by - or quoting - verified accounts (simulating the aftermath of the Twitter hacks in July 2020), or highlight them if you want to check how much of your timeline content is driven by verified accounts.
